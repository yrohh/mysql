The reason why I preprocessed raw data set was that I didn't know  how to import big data set into MySQL.
However I ended up to find out the way through googleing.

It was not that easy for me.

First, We need to check the directory that MySQL system allows.

SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'secure_file%'; <-- type this in MySQL.

then we can see the directory.

like this 
-> C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\

And then, move the big data set into that directory.
Ok, First step is done.

Second, We need to make an table that fits big data set careful with types of data.

like this
-> create table Test(
Id int primary key,
Name text,
Year int,
Gender text,
Count int);

and type this query in MySQL for importing.

-> load data infile 'C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/Test.csv' into table Test

fields terminated by ','

ignore 1 rows;

' Test ' is the big file which I wanted to import into MySQL.

With this way finally we can import big data into MySQL.
